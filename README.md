# next-mesh-apollo-monorepo-example

At the root of the monorepo, run:

`yarn install`

`yarn dev`

The app will be served at http://localhost:3000/
The GraphQL endpoint will be served at http://localhost:3000/api/graphql

The routes gets rebuilt and this might be the cause of performance issues we are facing when using multiple big swagger files (that I can't share unfortunately).
